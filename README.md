NEWS: Please Test DarkRP for Gmod 13! (11-19-2012)
======

Report GMod 13 issues here in this issue report:
https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP/issues/5

Things I want you to test:
- Loads of stuff
- try to change the settings and see if it works (I can't test EVERYTHING)
- see if you can get any errors (GIVE ME THOSE ERRORS)

Things I DON'T want you to test:
- The visuals of TAB menu. I know it looks fucked
- HTML shit (MOTD)


Please try to use the git protocol instead of SVN to get access to DarkRP. GitHub has a very nice program for it:
http://windows.github.com/


If you really can't/don't want to use git, you can still use SVN.
